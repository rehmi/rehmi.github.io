# Intrabody Power

## Overview

Intrabody Power is a project focused on the transmission of power and information through the human body. This research explores methods for using the human body as a conductive medium for low-power electrical signals. Our first patent in this area dates back to 1996:

- [US6211799: Method and apparatus for transbody transmission of power and information](http://www.google.com/patents/US6211799)

This patent describes techniques for transmitting power and data through the human body, potentially enabling new types of wearable or implantable devices that can communicate and receive power without traditional wiring or external antennas.
