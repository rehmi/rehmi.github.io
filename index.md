        <img src="/_assets/thumbnails/zeron.jpg" alt="ZeroN">
        <div class="project-card-content">
            <h3>ZeroN</h3>
            <p>A breakthrough in tangible interfaces that enables controlled levitation of physical objects in 3D space. ZeroN combines magnetic levitation with optical tracking to create a new interaction medium where digital and physical space are seamlessly integrated.</p>

    <a class="project-card" href="/projects/wearables-and-textiles/midi-jacket/">
        <img src="/_assets/thumbnails/midi-jacket.jpg" alt="MIDI Jacket">
        <div class="project-card-content">
            <h3>MIDI Jacket</h3>
            <p>An interactive musical garment that transforms body movements into MIDI signals through an array of custom textile sensors. This wearable instrument enables natural gestural control of electronic music while maintaining the comfort and flexibility of regular clothing.</p>
