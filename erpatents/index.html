In one implementation, a transmitter carried by the user transmits power and data to a receiver, which is also carried on the user&#39;s body. The signal that the transmitter applies to the user&#39;s body not only contains a data component, but also powers the receiver and enables it to detect and decode the data. In other implementations, the transmitter or the receiver is physically displaced from the user&#39;s body &#40;although both receiver and transmitter are coupled to environmental ground&#41;, and data and power are transmitted when the transmitter and receiver become sufficiently proximate—via the user&#39;s body—to permit capacitive coupling. The disclosed approach is amenable to a wide variety of applications, ranging from &quot;interbody&quot; exchange of digital information between individuals through physical contact &#40;e.g., a handshake&#41; to &quot;intrabody&quot; data transfer &#40;e.g.</p> <p><strong>Type:</strong> Grant</p> <p><strong>Filed:</strong> November 6, 1997</p> <p><strong>Date of Patent:</strong> April 3, 2001</p> <p><strong>Assignee:</strong> Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p> <p><strong>Inventors:</strong> E.
