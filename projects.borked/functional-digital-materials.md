# Functional Digital Materials

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

The Functional Digital Materials project, started in June 2009, explores a new approach to materials and manufacturing where discrete, functional components can be assembled into larger structures with emergent properties. This work bridges the gap between digital design and physical fabrication.

## Technical Details

### Material System
* Discrete building blocks
* Functional interfaces
* Assembly mechanisms
* Property programming

### Implementation
* Component design
* Interface specifications
* Assembly methods
* Property verification
