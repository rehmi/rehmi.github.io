# Sandcastles

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

After four years of trial-and-error experimentation, artist Vik Muniz and artist/researcher Marcelo Coelho successfully created drawings as tiny as they are tremendous: magnificent castles etched onto microscopic grains of sandâ€”a complete and innovative reversal of building a sand castle.

## Technical Process

### Initial Design
Muniz worked with Coelho and Post to devise a highly technical process involving both antiquated technology and innovative visual tools:
1. Created sketches of castles using a camera lucida
2. The optical superimposition device (created in 1807) turns images in front of the viewer into a projection on piece of paper
3. This allowed for precise tracing of the tiny castles

### Development Challenges
Several microscopic drawing processes were attempted over years with limited successes:
* Laser-inscription often destroyed the soft sand
* Some methods wouldn't appear distinct enough on harder grains

### Final Solution
The team finally settled on a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) microscope:
* Typically used for fixing integrated circuits on microchips
* Operates at highly-sensitive levels
* Yields precise castle shapes at microscopic scale

### Implementation
The FIB uses two screens:
* First screen frames the image, depicting the electrons needed to see the grain
* Second screen displays the ions which etch the grain
* Results in crisp images of Muniz's castles
