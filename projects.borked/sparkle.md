# Sp4rkl3

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

Sp4rkl3 is a dress that lights up due to electricity generated by its own motion. As Sp4rkl3's skirt swishes and sways, it provides a dynamic lightshow, encouraging its wearer to be active and giving others a visible gauge of her level of motion. There are no batteries; instead, a new power generation mechanism is used to create a dazzling effect with virtually no indication that electronics are involved.

Created by Kit Waal and Rehmi Post.
