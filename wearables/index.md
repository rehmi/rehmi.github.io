# Wearables & E-textiles Research

My research in wearable technology and electronic textiles focuses on creating interactive garments and textile-based interfaces that seamlessly integrate computation with everyday objects and clothing. This work spans multiple institutions including MIT Media Lab and encompasses projects from basic electronic textile techniques to complete interactive garment systems.

## Research Themes

### Interactive Garments
Developing clothing that responds to and interacts with users through:
* Motion and gesture sensing
* Embedded computation
* Novel interaction paradigms

### Textile Interfaces
Creating new ways to integrate electronics with fabrics:
* Conductive embroidery techniques
* Flexible circuit design
* Textile-based sensors

### Stretchable Electronics
Innovating flexible and durable electronic components:
* Stretchable interconnects
* Textile-compatible components
* Washable electronics

## Featured Projects

### [MIDI Jacket](/projects/wearables/midi-jacket/)
An interactive musical garment that allows wearers to create music through movement and gesture. The jacket demonstrates the integration of complex sensing and interaction in a fully wearable form factor.

### [Sp4rkl3](/projects/wearables/sparkle/)
Novel approaches to embedding light-emitting elements in textiles, creating dynamic, interactive fabric displays while maintaining textile properties.

### [E-broidery](/projects/wearables/e-broidery/)
Pioneering techniques for creating electronic circuits through traditional embroidery methods. This foundational work established new approaches for integrating computation with textiles.

Key innovations:
* Conductive thread circuit patterns
* Machine-embroidered electronic components
* Washable electronic textiles

### [uTartan](/projects/wearables/utartan/)
Exploring traditional textile patterns as interfaces for electronic systems. This project merges cultural textile traditions with modern interaction design.

### [Interactive Tablecloth](/projects/wearables/interactive-tablecloth/)
A large-scale interactive textile surface that demonstrates the scalability of e-textile techniques to furniture and environmental interfaces.

### [Stretchable Cable](/projects/wearables/stretchable-cable/)
Development of reliable, flexible interconnects for wearable systems that can withstand the mechanical demands of clothing.
