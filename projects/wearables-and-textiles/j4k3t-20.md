# j4k3t 2.0

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

The j4k3t 2.0 project, created by Rehmi Post, Kit Waal, and Noah Vawter, demonstrates the evolution of wearable technology from earlier work like the Musical MIDI Jacket. While maintaining accessibility - requiring only a sewing machine and soldering iron - j4k3t 2.0 achieves significant advances in miniaturization and sophistication while being, in the creators' words, "350% cuter."

## Historical Context

The Musical MIDI Jacket (1997) was perhaps the first wearable system to demonstrate the use of off-the-shelf conductive threads and fabrics as media for sensing and electronic interconnection. j4k3t 2.0 shows how these techniques have evolved, becoming smaller and more sophisticated while remaining accessible to makers.

## Technical Details

### Hardware Integration
* Advanced conductive thread techniques
* Miniaturized electronic components
* Improved connection methods
* Robust power distribution

### Construction Methods
* Machine-sewable electronics
* Accessible fabrication techniques
* Durable connections
* Washable design considerations
