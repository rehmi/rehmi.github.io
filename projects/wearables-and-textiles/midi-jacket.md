# MIDI Jacket: Wearable Musical Interface

\toc

## Overview

The MIDI Jacket is a wearable musical interface that transforms body movements into MIDI signals, allowing wearers to create music through natural gestures and movements.

## Technical Details

### Hardware Components
* Custom textile pressure sensors
* Conductive fabric interconnects
* Microcontroller integration
* Wireless MIDI interface

### Sensor System
The jacket uses an array of custom-designed textile pressure sensors strategically placed at key movement points:
* Shoulder articulation
* Elbow bend sensors
* Wrist rotation
* Torso movement

## Documentation
Here's an example of the jacket in use:
