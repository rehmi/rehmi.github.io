# Intrabody Power

## Overview

Intrabody Power is a project focused on the transmission of power and information through the human body. This research, dating back to 1996, explores innovative methods for using the human body as a conductive medium for low-power electrical signals.

## Key Achievements

The project led to several patents, including:

- [US6211799: Method and apparatus for transbody transmission of power and information](http://www.google.com/patents/US6211799)

This patent describes techniques for transmitting power and data through the human body, potentially enabling new types of wearable or implantable devices that can communicate and receive power without traditional wiring or external antennas.

## Related Patents

While not directly titled as Intrabody Power, the following patents may be related to or have stemmed from this research:

- [US6210771: Electrically active textiles and articles made therefrom](http://www.google.com/patents/US6210771)
- [US6493933: Method of making flexible electronic circuitry](http://www.google.com/patents/US6493933)

These patents suggest applications and manufacturing methods that could be relevant to intrabody power transmission, particularly in the realm of wearable technology.

## Impact and Future Directions

Intrabody Power research opens up possibilities for:

1. Medical devices that can operate within the body without external wiring
2. Seamless integration of technology with the human body
3. Novel forms of secure, short-range communication

Further research in this area continues to explore new applications and refine the technology for practical use.
