This meeting would prove to be pivotal in my career trajectory. A few months later, after showing Thad the wearable computer I had independently built, he invited me to join him and the other members of the &quot;Borg&quot; as a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab.</p> <h2 id=historical_context ><a href="#historical_context" class=header-anchor >Historical Context</a></h2> <p>The MIT &quot;Borgs&quot; were a pioneering group in wearable computing, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with personal, always-on computing devices in the mid-1990s. This work laid important foundations for many of the wearable technologies we take for granted today, from smartwatches to augmented reality glasses.</p> <h2 id=impact ><a href="#impact" class=header-anchor >Impact</a></h2> <p>This early work in wearable computing helped establish many of the fundamental principles and challenges in the field:</p> <ul> <li><p>Integration of computing into daily life</p> <li><p>Always-on, always-available computing</p> <li><p>Human-computer interaction in mobile contexts</p> <li><p>Power and heat management</p> <li><p>Social implications of wearable technology</p> </ul> <p>The experience and insights gained during this period influenced many of my later projects in e-textiles and wearable technology.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Rehmi Post.
