# MEMS Interferometric Accelerometer

## Overview

We demonstrate a novel microfabricated accelerometer based on optical interferometry principles. This innovative design achieves remarkable sensitivity while maintaining a relatively simple fabrication process.

## Technical Innovation

The accelerometer's core mechanism consists of surface-micromachined interdigital fingers that are alternately attached to:
- A proof mass
- A support substrate

When illuminated with coherent light, these fingers generate a series of diffracted optical beams. By measuring the intensity of a diffracted beam, we can detect subangstrom displacements between the proof mass and frame.

## Technical Details

### Fabrication
- Two-mask silicon process
- Surface micromachining techniques
- Simple, cost-effective manufacturing approach

### Detection System
- Standard laser diode light source
- Conventional photodetector
- No complex optical arrangements required

### Performance
- Minimum detectable acceleration: 2 µg/√Hz
- Measurement bandwidth: 1 Hz centered at 650 Hz
- Sensitivity: Six orders of magnitude below the acceleration of gravity
