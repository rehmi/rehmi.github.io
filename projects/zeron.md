# ZeroN: Levitated Tangible Interface

## Overview
Imagine a physical object that floats through the air, unconstrained by gravity, which can move freely to display the motion of a planet in an orrery, or serve as a tangible interface element that can be positioned in 3D space.

## Technical Details
The system combines magnetic levitation with mechanical actuation and computer control to enable controlled three-dimensional movement of an object in space. This creates a new type of human-computer interface element that can be physically present in 3D space.

## Results & Impact
This novel interface paradigm opened up new possibilities for:
- Physical visualization of 3D data
- Tangible interaction in 3D space
- Interactive simulation of astronomical phenomena
- Novel user interface metaphors
