# Multitouch Table at MoMA (TauFish)

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

This interactive installation was developed in cooperation with MoMA New York and shown at the exhibition "Un-Private House" at MoMA in 1999. The project demonstrated early innovations in touch interaction and sensing technology, allowing visitors to explore architectural content through natural touch gestures.

## Technical Implementation

### Sensing System
* Custom sensing array under the table surface
* Precise x-y position detection of hands
* Multiple simultaneous touch detection
* Above-surface proximity sensing

### Operating Principle
* Electrode charge rate measurement
* Hand proximity affects charge requirements
* Slower charge rate indicates hand presence
* Mathematical model predicts charge amounts based on hand location
* "Hotspot" recognition through charge pattern analysis
