# MOMA

## Overview
The Museum of Modern Art in New York City presented a compelling environment in which to explore technologies for smart environments. We worked with a team led by Terry Riley, the Chief Curator for Architecture and Design, initially on an exhibit exploring changing notions of public and private spaces. The goal of this installation was to replace conventional kiosks with embedded sensing and ambient displays so that the supporting electronic information would be accessible in its natural, rich context.
