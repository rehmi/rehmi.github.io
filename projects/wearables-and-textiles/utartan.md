# µTartan

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

µTartan (microTartan), developed in 2009, explores the integration of microelectronics directly into woven textile patterns. The project combines traditional tartan weaving patterns with modern electronic functionality, creating a new form of interactive fabric.

## Technical Details

### Electronic Integration
* Microscale electronic components
* Woven conductive threads
* Power distribution network
* Data communication fabric

### Manufacturing Process
* Custom weaving techniques
* Component embedding methods
* Circuit-fabric integration
* Durability considerations
