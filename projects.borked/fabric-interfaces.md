# Fabric Interfaces

## Overview
To change radically the physical shape and feeling of technology, designers must also be able to change the materials from which it is made. This project explored how to integrate computational and interface capabilities directly into textiles and fabric materials.

## Technical Details
The project developed new techniques for:
- Conductive fabric sensors
- Textile-based circuits
- Fabric-based input devices
- Wearable interface elements
- Integration of electronics with textiles

## Results & Impact
The research led to:
- New methods for creating interactive textile surfaces
- Techniques for embedding electronics in fabric
- Applications in wearable computing
- Novel interface paradigms using soft materials
