Muniz first created sketches of castles using a camera lucida, an optical superimposition device created in 1807 that turns images in front of the viewer into a projection on piece of paper, allowing him to trace the tiny castles.</p> <p>Next, he sent these drawings to Coelho and Post, who tried several microscopic drawing processes for several years with limited successes. Laser-inscription, for example, often destroyed the soft sand, or wouldn&#39;t appear distinct enough on harder grains. Finally, they settled on a Focused Ion Beam &#40;FIB&#41; microscope, a device typically used for fixing integrated circuits on microchips, at highly-sensitive levels to yield the shape of a castle at a microscopic scale.</p> <p>The FIB uses two screens: the first frames the image, depicting the electrons needed to see the grain. The second screen displays the ions which etch the grain, resulting in a crisp image of Muniz&#39;s castles.</p> <h2 id=documentation ><a href="#documentation" class=header-anchor >Documentation</a></h2> <p><a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHsjE4mnZx">Flickr album of Vik&#39;s visit to MIT</a></p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Rehmi Post.
