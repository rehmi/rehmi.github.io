# Field Imaging

## Overview
As computers move off the desktop they must be able to detect interaction with a user in their immediate environment. This project developed new approaches to field imaging for detecting user presence and interaction in space.

## Technical Details
The research explored:
- Electric field sensing
- Capacitive imaging techniques
- Non-contact user detection
- 3D interaction spaces
- Environmental sensing

## Results & Impact
The project contributed to:
- New sensor technologies
- Interaction detection methods
- Ambient computing interfaces
- Spatial user tracking

## Publications
- Post, E.R., et al. "Field Imaging for Ambient Intelligence"
- Technical papers on field sensing methods
