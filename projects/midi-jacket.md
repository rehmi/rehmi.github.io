# MIDI Jacket: Wearable Musical Interface

\toc

## Overview

The MIDI Jacket is a wearable musical interface that transforms body movements into MIDI signals, allowing wearers to create music through natural gestures and movements.

## Technical Details

### Hardware
* Flexible textile sensors
* Custom PCB design for signal processing
* Wireless MIDI interface
* Power management system

### Software
* Real-time gesture recognition
* MIDI signal processing
* Wireless communication protocol

```julia
# Example code showing sensor data processing
function process_sensor_data(raw_data)
    # Signal processing implementation
    return processed_data
end
```
