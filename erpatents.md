Particle may be measured by optical interferometry, optical leverage, resonant electric field absorption, or by producing an image of the particle motion and processing the image data to obtain values representing the acceleration forces on the trap in one to six degrees of freedom. The electrodynamic trap employs electrodes to which a time-varying potential are applied to produce a quadupole field that constrains the charged particles to a specific location between said electrodes by a substantially linear, tunable restoring force.

- ###### [Method and apparatus for inertial sensing via measurement of trapped orbit dynamics](https://patents.justia.com/patent/7755765)
    
    **Patent number:** 7755765
    
    **Abstract:** An inertial sensor consisting of an electrodynamic trap for suspending one or more charged particles and a readout device for measuring variations in the position or motion of the particles when the trap is subjected to acceleration forces. Particle may be measured by optical interferometry, optical leverage, resonant electric field absorption, or by producing an image of the particle motion and processing the image data to obtain values representing the acceleration forces on the trap in one to six degrees of freedom. The electrodynamic trap employs electrodes to which a time-varying potential are applied to produce a quadupole field that constrains the charged particles to a specific location between said electrodes by a substantially linear, tunable restoring force.

- ###### [Method of making flexible electronic circuitry](https://patents.justia.com/patent/6493933)
    
    **Patent number:** 6493933
    
    **Abstract:** Stitchable electrical components have flexible, conductive leads and are encased, at least partially, in sealed packages. Conductive threads, yarns, or fiber bundles are patterned onto a flexible substrate (e.g., a textile panel). To form a circuit, the component leads are conductively stitched, spot welded, or otherwise joined to a textile panel so as to form connections between at least some of the stitched leads so as to form an electrical circuit. Alternatively, leads stitched into or otherwise joined to a textile pattern may be welded or otherwise permanently joined to flexible or non-flexible component leads to form a circuit. Multiple panels of circuitry so formed may then be physically and electrically joined at various locations by a combination of stitching, welding, and/or other joining means, preferably with interposed insulating layers, to form a multilayer flexible circuit.

    **Publication number:** 20140145522
    
    **Abstract:** Electromagnetic digital materials are made up of a set of voxels, some of which are made from electromagnetically active materials. Each voxel is adapted to be assembled into a structure according to a regular physical geometry and an electromagnetic geometry, and a majority of the voxels in the set are reversibly connectable to other voxels. Voxels in the set may differ in material composition or property from other voxels in the set. Voxels may be arranged into multi-voxel parts that are assembled into the structure according to a regular physical geometry and the electromagnetic geometry. Electromagnetic structures may be made from the electromagnetic digital material, and may be fabricated by an automated process that includes assembling a set of voxels by reversibly connecting the voxels to each other according to a regular physical geometry and an electromagnetic geometry and assembling the reversibly connected voxels into the electromagnetic structure.

    **Patent number:** 6210771
    
    **Abstract:** Fabrics are used as integral elements of electrical circuitry—to facilitate control over the operation of external components connected thereto, to serve as substrates onto which electrical components are connected, or as the electrical components themselves. In one aspect, selective, anisotropic electrical conductivity is achieved using conductive fibers running along one weave direction and non-conductive fibers running along the opposite direction. The conductive fibers, which may be continuous or arranged in lanes, serve as electrical conduits capable of carrying data signals and/or power, and may be connected, for example, to electrical components soldered directly onto the fabric. In a second aspect, passive electrical components are integrated directly textiles using threads having selected electrical properties.

- ###### [Method and apparatus for transbody transmission of power and information](https://patents.justia.com/patent/6211799)
    
    **Patent number:** 6211799
    
    **Abstract:** Capacitive coupling is used to transmit data and power through a user's body. In one implementation, a transmitter carried by the user transmits power and data to a receiver, which is also carried on the user's body. The signal that the transmitter applies to the user's body not only contains a data component, but also powers the receiver and enables it to detect and decode the data. In other implementations, the transmitter or the receiver is physically displaced from the user's body (although both receiver and transmitter are coupled to environmental ground), and data and power are transmitted when the transmitter and receiver become sufficiently proximate—via the user's body—to permit capacitive coupling. The disclosed approach is amenable to a wide variety of applications, ranging from “interbody” exchange of digital information between individuals through physical contact (e.g., a handshake) to “intrabody” data transfer (e.g.
