# MEMS Interferometric Accelerometer

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

We demonstrate a promising type of microfabricated accelerometer based on optical interferometry. The interferometer consists of surface-micromachined interdigital fingers that are alternately attached to a proof mass and support substrate. This novel approach achieved superior sensitivity and accuracy compared to conventional capacitive sensing methods.

## Technical Details

### Design Implementation
* Surface-micromachined interdigital fingers
* Alternating attachment between:
  - Proof mass
  - Support substrate
* Coherent light illumination system
* Diffracted optical beam measurement

### Performance Metrics
* Minimum detectable acceleration: 2 µg/√Hz
* Measurement bandwidth: 1 Hz centered at 650 Hz
* Performance level: Six orders of magnitude below the acceleration of gravity

### Construction
* Two-mask silicon process
* Standard laser diode implementation
* Conventional photodetector
* Subangstrom displacement detection
