# Stretchable Cable

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

We show how to arrange non-elastic elements (wires, fibers, etc.) in a geometry that can extend to several times its resting length. Furthermore, this can be done with existing braiding techniques and materials, obviating the need for specialized materials or equipment.

## Technical Innovation

### Electrical Properties
* The resistance of this cable remains constant when stretched, unlike other elastic conductors whose resistance is a bulk or surface property
* Since the conducting fiber does not itself stretch, the basic properties of the wire do not change as the braid is stretched
* Multiple distinct, adjacent conductors and alternating conductors can form transmission lines with predictable impedance
* Twisted pairs increase noise immunity

## Technical Details

### Construction Methods
* Single conductor forming a helical wrap around the inner elastomer
* Multiple conductors woven into the braid in parallel to form a stretchable ribbon cable
* Optical fibers may be incorporated into the braid

## Technical Innovation

### Novel Aspects
* Braided conductors, while known in cable manufacture, have not appeared in prior art as structures intended to provide extensible electrical interconnects
* Traditional braided conductors are used as electrically parallel conductors:
  - In braided shielding: uninsulated to form an effective shield at uniform potential
  - In Litz wire: insulated to form distinct but parallel paths for high-frequency, high-current signals

### Impedance Characteristics
* When a braid containing a balanced transmission line is stretched, the spacing between conductors decreases
* The characteristic impedance of the transmission line changes predictably
* An adaptive impedance matching network may be included at each end to:
  - Provide proper termination
  - Compensate for variation of transmission line impedance as the braid is stretched

## Applications

* Wearable electronics
* E-textile systems
* Medical devices
* Flexible electronics
* Transmission line systems
* Stretchable interconnects

## Sensing Capabilities
* By sensing the change in impedance, drive electronics can:
  - Compensate for stretching effects
  - Determine degree of extension of the braid
  - Maintain signal integrity
