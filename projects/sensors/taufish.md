# Multitouch Table at MoMA

Project Date: 1999

[Un-Private House at MoMA](http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1999/un-privatehouse/credits.html)
 
Exhibit developed in cooperation with MoMA New York and shown at the exhibition "un-privatehouse" at MoMA in 1999. For an interactive multitouchcable, I developed a sensing array under the table surface that locates the exact x and y position of each users hands on and above the table. The rate that electrical charge on each of the electrodes in the array is measured. As a hand approaches the table, more charge is required, slowing down this rate. A model that predicts the amounts of charges as a function of the hand location is used to recognize when the hand enters a "hotspot".
