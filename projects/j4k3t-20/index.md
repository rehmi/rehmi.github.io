# j4k3t 2.0

![j4k3t 2.0 prototype](02.jpg)

## Overview

j4k3t 2.0 represents the evolution of wearable electronic interfaces, building upon the foundation laid by the Musical MIDI Jacket from 1997. This project demonstrates how e-textile techniques have matured while maintaining their accessibility to makers and DIY enthusiasts.

## Innovation

The Musical MIDI Jacket, developed in 1997 by Media Lab students, was a pioneering project that first demonstrated the use of off-the-shelf conductive threads and fabrics as media for:
- Sensing
- Electronic interconnection

j4k3t 2.0 shows how these techniques have evolved, becoming:
- Smaller
- More sophisticated
- More aesthetically refined (or as the team puts it, "350% cuter")
- Still accessible to anyone with basic tools (sewing machine and soldering iron)

## Historical Context

This project stands as an important milestone in the evolution of e-textiles, showing how the field progressed from early experiments to more refined and practical implementations while maintaining the core principle of accessibility to makers and DIY enthusiasts.
