# Sp4rkl3

![Sp4rkl3 dress in action](03.jpg)

## Overview

Sp4rkl3 is an innovative dress that creates its own light show powered entirely by the wearer's movement. As the skirt moves and sways, it generates electricity that powers LED illumination, creating a dynamic display that responds to the wearer's activity level. The design contains no batteries, instead utilizing a novel power generation mechanism that creates a dazzling effect while keeping the electronics virtually invisible.

## Technical Innovation

The dress demonstrates a new approach to wearable power generation, harvesting electrostatic energy from natural movement. This technology not only powers the LED display but also serves as a visible gauge of the wearer's motion level, encouraging physical activity through an immediate visual feedback loop.
