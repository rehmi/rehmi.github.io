# MIDI Jacket

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

The MIDI Jacket is a wearable musical interface that transforms body movements into MIDI signals, allowing wearers to create music through natural gestures and movements. Developed at the MIT Media Lab in 1997, it was one of the early demonstrations of wearable musical interfaces.

## Technical Details

### Hardware
* Conductive fabric sensors for bend detection
* Custom PCB for sensor interfacing
* MIDI interface circuit
* Embedded microcontroller
* Power management system

### Software
* Real-time gesture recognition
* MIDI signal processing and mapping
* Sensor calibration system

The MIDI Jacket was demonstrated at:
* ACM SIGGRAPH
* MIT Media Lab demonstrations
* Various wearable computing workshops

Key innovations:
* Integration of conductive textiles with MIDI control
* Natural gesture-based musical interface
* Early example of wearable computing integration
