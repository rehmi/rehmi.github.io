# Wearable Computing (1995-2000)

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Personal Background

In 1994 I first met Thad Starner and his wearable computer (Lizzy) in a coffee shop. Meeting him again a few months later I showed him the wearable computer I had built, and he invited me to join him (and the other members of the Borg) as a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab.

## Overview

This early pioneering work in wearable computing from 1995-2000 explored the fundamental integration of computation and electronics into clothing and accessories. The research helped establish foundational approaches to wearable technology and influenced subsequent developments in the field.

## Technical Developments

### Hardware Integration
* Miniaturized computing systems
* Power management solutions
* Sensor integration
* Display technologies
* Early wearable input/output methods

### Software Systems
* Context-aware applications
* User interaction models
* Sensor fusion algorithms
* Power management systems
* Wearable interface design

## Research Impact

* Established foundational concepts in wearable computing
* Influenced subsequent wearable technology development
* Advanced understanding of human-computer interaction
* Created new paradigms for mobile computing
* Contributed to the formation of the wearable computing community

## Legacy Projects

This early work led to numerous subsequent developments:
* [MIDI Jacket](/projects/wearables-and-textiles/midi-jacket/) (1997)
* [j4k3t 2.0](/projects/wearables-and-textiles/j4k3t-20/) (2006)
* [Sp4rkl3](/projects/wearables-and-textiles/sparkle/) (2008)
* [ÂµTartan](/projects/wearables-and-textiles/utartan/) (2009)
