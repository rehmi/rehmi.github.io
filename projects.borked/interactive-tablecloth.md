# Interactive Tablecloth

{{showtags}}

\toc

## Overview

The Interactive Tablecloth project, initiated in August 2009, explores the integration of sensing and interaction capabilities into everyday textile objects. This project transforms an ordinary tablecloth into an interactive surface that can sense touch, presence, and objects.

## Technical Details

### Technology Integration
* Capacitive sensing grid
* Conductive thread circuitry
* Touch detection system
* Object recognition capabilities

### Construction
* Custom weaving techniques
* Conductive fiber integration
* Washable electronics
* Edge connection system
